DIRECTIONS

1. Use the mockups to recreate the login pages for Twitter and Facebook. Utilize flexbox. 

2. If time allows, go to youtube.com in your browser and recreate the layout of the landing page. You may use emtpy divs in the places where there are icons. 

HINTS

Don't worry about the fonts right now. They won't match exactly, and that's okay.

When you get to the Facebook page, look up the box-shadow CSS property to recreate the 3D effect on the box with the login fields and buttons.

Start by sketching out divs based on whether the content will be organized in a row or column. 

Some of the colors you might need are:
    Twitter blue: #38A1F2
    Twitter footer links: #5b7083
    Facebook body: #EFF2F5
    Facebook blue: #1B76F2
    Facebook button: #3AA722
